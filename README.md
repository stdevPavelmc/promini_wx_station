# DIY meteo station

For fun and learn, it uses a ESP8266 (NodeMCU) and a ProMini arduinos linked via I2C, the code for the ESP8266 is on the [esp8266_wx_station](https://github.com/stdevPavelmc/esp8266_wx_station) repo

This is an early stage and design is evolving...

## NOTE

This project is a Platformio one, if you use arduino simply copy the files in the `src` folder and change the extensions to .ino and remove the `#include <Arduino.h>` on top of the main.cpp
